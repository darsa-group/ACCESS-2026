**AI and deep learning** are [transforming research in ecology and entomology](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2002545117), 
but starting to use and developing these methods -- and applying them to real-world problems -- can be daunting.
[InsectAI](https://insectai.eu/) ACCESS empowers early-career researchers to leverage state-of-the-art imaging techniques, AI and other methods to tackle challenges in insect ecology and entomology.

## Where and when
ACCESS-2026 is an **in-person, residential summer school** based in Aarhus, Denmark. The event will run from **September 28th** to **October 3th, 2026** (provisional dates). 

## What we offer
* • A fully-funded course - **free tuition, and refunds for accommodation, food and travel** for the selected candidates: we can support between 15 and 20 participants, but might be able to host a few self-funded candidates
* • A series of **guest lectures** and **practical workshops** from international experts
* • A **project-based** learning experience within a **multidisciplinary student and mentor team**

## Who the course is for
* • Biologists (entomologists, ecologists, etc) wanting to apply computational methods to their fields
* • Computer and data scientists (engineers, physicists, etc) seeking to translate their expertise to study insects
* • We particularly support early-career researchers (graduate students, PhDs and postdocs)

## What will you do
The course is structured around a group project you will develop in a team of 2-4 students. We will provide you with a mock funding call, and you and your team will write a collaborative research project to submit as a mock proposal.  

Each group is assigned a mentor that will advise them on their project before and during the in-person course, and will offer guidance on self-guided resources to prepare for the course (i.e. relevant papers, coding tutorials, etc). 

You will meet online with your group starting around 2 months in advance of the in-person course, and start work on your collaborative project. Before and during the course there will be opportunities for feedback from peers, mentors and instructors. 

The in-person course in Aarhus will consist of lectures, case studies and workshops, with time allocated for group project work each day.
