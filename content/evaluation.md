In the application form you will be asked to provide some personal details, upload your CV, and write two short paragraphs of up to 1500 characters each.

The **first paragraph** should describe your background, your interest in the topic, and what you hope to gain from the course. This helps us assess your motivation to attend the summer school and its potential impact on your career.

The **second paragraph** should describe one or more specific research question(s) or problem(s) you are excited to tackle in invertebrate evolution, ecology, behaviour, conservation, distribution, or related fields. This allows us to evaluate your creativity and your ability to identify meaningful gaps / opportunities in the field.

Because the course is project-based, the proposed research idea(s) are an important part of the application. Your project could involve monitoring insect behaviour in the field or laboratory, detecting or quantifying traits in specimens, building new hardware or mobile applications, automating existing research tasks, or generating new types of biological data. We are interested in a broad range of ideas related to computational entomology and will also consider projects involving other terrestrial invertebrates.

Applications will be reviewed by the organisers with the help of a select group of core members from InsectAI. All submitted information is treated confidentially, and applicants may request deletion of their data after the notice period has ended (see "Selection outcome").

Each application will be reviewed by two evaluators whenever possible, while avoiding conflicts of interest (for example supervisor–student or teacher–student relationships).

## Shortlisting

The first stage of the evaluation is based only on the two paragraphs submitted in the application form. These two components have equal weighting and are used to assess:

- motivation and relevance of the course to the applicant’s career
- originality and feasibility of the proposed research question

Based on this first evaluation, we will pre-select a number of candidates corresponding to approximately 1.5 times the number of available places.

Evaluators will then discuss the shortlisted candidates collectively and attempt to group applicants into thematic clusters that could form productive project teams.

## Final evaluation

During the final stage we will also examine the submitted CVs to support the final decision. Complementarity between candidates, including differences in expertise, background, and skills, is also considered.

Please note that *joint applications are not permitted*. Applicants should not attempt to coordinate their submissions with other candidates.

## Selection outcome

Once teams have been formed, selected candidates will be contacted to confirm their acceptance. This is expected to occur around the **beginning of June 2026**. Selected candidates will have **15 days** to confirm their participation; otherwise the place will be offered to the next candidate on the list.

There may be more selected candidates than available funding. In this case, applicants will be contacted in order of evaluation score and asked whether they could attend the course using their own funding (for example scholarships, institutional support, or scientific society grants). Invitations to participate with personal funding depend first on evaluation score and second on the availability of funds.

When all places have been filled, the results will be communicated to all remaining applicants, at the latest by the **end of June 2026**.

In previous editions the course has received a large number of applications, so please keep in mind that participation is competitive.
