In the application form you will be asked about some of your personal details, you will upload your CV, and you will have to write two short paragraphs, of 1500 characters each. 

The first paragraph is about your background, your interest in the topic and what you hope you will gain from the course. This will help us assess your motivation to attend the summer school and its impact on your career. 

The second paragraph is about a specific research question or problem you are excited to tackle in invertebrate evolution, ecology, behaviour, distribution, etc. This will help us evaluate your creativity and insight into existing gaps in the field. 

Applications will be reviewed by the organisers with the help of a select group of InsectAI core members; all your information is confidential and you can request its deletion after a specified period. 
Each application will be reviewed by at least two persons, avoiding conflicts of interest (i.e. supervisor / student, teacher / student, etc). 

The first evaluation stage is based only on the two paragraphs submitted during the application; each has equal weighting. 

We will pre-select a number of candidates approximately 1.5 times the number of slots available. We will then discuss among all evaluators, and try to group candidates by themes. 
In the final stage of the evaluation, we will also look at the CVs to make a final decision. 
Complementarity between candidates is also considered, please note however that joint applications are not permitted (i.e. please do not try to match yourself with another candidate). 

Once the teams have been formed, we will get in touch with selected candidates to confirm acceptance, this should be around the beginning of June 2026; you will have 15 days to confirm, or the slot will offered to the next in line. 

There might be more slots than available funding available. In this case, we will contact candidates in order of score, and ask if they could attend the course with their own funds (e.g. scholarships, institutional fund, scientific society grant). Invitation to participate with own funds is contingent on evaluation score first, availability of funds second. 

When all the slots have been filled, we will communicate the results to all other candidates, at the latest at the end of June 2026. 

In previous editions, we have received a large number of applications, so please bear in mind that attendance is competitive and all but guaranteed.
