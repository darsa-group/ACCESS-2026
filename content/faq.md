<!-- #### *I am a [insert any biological discipline related to invertebrates], is this course for me?*
Yes! If you study invertebrates, their evolution, ecology, physiology, behaviour, distribution you can apply. You should think about a clear application for technology to your study organism(s) / system, and about the impact it would have on your research. 

#### *I am a data / computer scientist, engineer or from another technical background, with little experience in entomology, is this course for me?* 
Yes! We encourage you to apply, but you need to demonstrate an existing commitment to studying insects (or invertebrates more generally) and a clear project idea that addresses an important research gap in entomology, ecology and/or biodiversity monitoring.  -->

#### *I have no previous programming / electronics experience, can I participate?*
While it is an advantage to have previous experience with coding, working with electronics and so on, and this is taken into account during evaluation, it does not preclude your participation. Students are expected to do up to 30h of preparation for the course, and this includes self-guided coding tutorials, for example. 

#### *Will I learn how to code during the course?!?*
Unlikely, there's only so much we can show you in a week! However, the workshops and demos should are structured in a way that you should be able to follow even with no technical background. The aim of the course is to signpost resources and approaches that you can use to learn what you need to leverage state-of-the-art technology for insects monitoring. 

#### *Will I get to work on my own project during the summer school?*
Not necessarily. You will work on a project together with your group (2-3 students) and supported by your mentor; this project may or may not be close to the project you submitted during application. We try our best to match students with similar interests, and sometimes groups end up working on a project close to one of the members', but some other times you will have to come up with a new project to work on all together. 

#### *So what's the point of submitting a project during application?!?*
It serves two purposes: to evaluate your existing understanding of the technologies we touch on during the course and how you foresee them applied to your research; and it allows us to get to know your interests and therefore create groups around a similar theme as well as assigning mentors based on their expertise. 

#### *Will we run an experiment during the course?*
Unfortunately no, due to the short duration we do not have the time to collect data. You are more than welcome to bring your own data to explore during the course though!
