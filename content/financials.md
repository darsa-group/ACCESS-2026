The summer school is sponsored by the InsectAI COST Action, and reimbursements follows the COST Association rules. There are no special provisions for training courses, so reimbursement follows the general event attendance rules. 

This means that all **participants need to pay upfront** and claim reimbursement after the course has ended. 
Unfortunately we cannot cover costs directly due to administrative constraints. 

The reimbursement is split into two parts: a travel part and a daily allowance part. 

For the travel part, participants must submit the relevant travel receipts (>50km), and will be reimbursed for the exact amount. Importantly, only uninterrupted travel can be reimbursed (i.e. no stopping in one location on the way to the event for more than 24h), otherwise only one leg of the trip can be reimbursed. 

For the daily allowance part, this is a fixed per-diem amount, and will cover accommodation, food and local travel (<50km). Participants will be invoiced by the venue for these costs shortly before the course starts. 

Let's clarify with an example: a candidate applies to ACCESS before the deadline of April 15th. She receives an offer to attend the summer school on May 20th. She accepts the offer, and immediately starts planning her trip to Aarhus: she books and pays for travel herself, around 500 EUR return trip. Some time before the beginning of the summer school, around August 15th, she receives an invoice for the accommodation and food of 5'600 DK (~750 EUR): she pays this herself as well. She arrives in Aarhus and, during the course, she receives support for filling in her reimbursement claim. After ACCESS has ended, she submits the reimbursement claim and receives 1'250 EUR within 1-4 weeks. 

In the past, participants have been able to have their institution or grant pay for travel and accommodation and food, receive the individual reimbursement, and pay these funds back to their institute or grant. How this works exactly depends on the institute or grant in question, you can contact those responsible for assistance. 
It is not possible to directly reimburse an institute or grant, it is required that it is an individual. 

While we understand that not everyone is in a position to cover these expenses upfront, we regret that we cannot do otherwise due to limitations of the COST reimbursement system. 
We have and will endeavour to make the reimbursement process as smooth and as fast as possible, so that participants are out of pocket for the least time possible.
