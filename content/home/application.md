<!-- ### Course requirements
The course is designed for early career researchers interested in computational entomology, whether they come from a biological or data science background. Specific requirements are as follows:
* Programming experience -- Candidates must demonstrate at least basic programming skills, ideally in python. Otherwise, candidates will be expected to develop those skills by the start of the course.
* Time commitment -- You must confirm that, if selected, **you will be able to dedicate time** to prepare for the course (30h, remotely) and then physically attend the 5-day event.
* Above all, candidates must be **excited** to apply new technologies and methods to answer interesting biological questions! -->

<!-- ### Selection process -->
<!-- We will assess the motivation, competence and vision of applicants using this [application form](https://forms.gle/cwmXzYmrKPD2e71y5). The form requests the following:
* Motivation (Text) -- You will need to provide a motivation statement (max 1500 characters) explaining your background, **why you are interested in the topic**, and what you hope to gain from the summer school. Ensure you explain what you have already done in this direction.
* CV  (PDF) -- You must provide a CV, which will help us understand **your background, seniority and current expertise**. 
* Project idea (text) -- Importantly, this course is project-based. You must describe, in **1500 characters**, **a specific research question or problem you (or others) have or (will have)**, related to insect ecology, behaviour, entomology, etc. Ensure you explain both the biological context and how this course would help you address this issue. 
Do not be afraid of being creative and thinking out of the box: your project could be to monitor behaviour in the field or in the lab; to detect or quantify traits in insect specimens; to build novel hardware or mobile applications; to automate a task you can already do or to obtain new content. We are interested in any project related to computational entomology, and will consider projects related to other terrestrial invertebrates. -->

<!-- ### Matching process
We will also ask you several additional questions during your application. 
Should you be selected, we will use this information to form teams of candidates based on complementary skills and interests.

Throughout the project work, you will work within your team to develop an independent project idea rooted in computational entomology.
You will be supported throughout the process, both before and during the summer school, by a mentor who will work with you and your team,
with multiple opportunities to exchange with other teams and mentors.

To complete your application, please fill out the [application form](https://forms.gle/cwmXzYmrKPD2e71y5) **by April 15th, 2025**. -->


## Requirements

The course is aimed at early-career researchers interested in computational entomology from either biological or data-science backgrounds.

Applicants should:
- have **basic programming skills** (preferably in Python), or be willing to learn before the course;
- be able to dedicate **~30 hours of preparation** before the event, over two months;
- attend the **full 5-day in-person course**, but most of all
- be excited to apply computational tools to biological questions!

The application requires a CV and two short paragraphs describing your motivation and one or more research question(s) you would like to explore in invertebrate (preferably insect) ecology, behaviour, evolution, conservation or related fields.

## How to apply
*Application form link will be published soon...*

#### Selection process
Applications are evaluated by the organisers together with select members of the InsectAI core group. Selection is based primarily on motivation and the proposed research idea(s), with the final stage also considering the CV and the complementarity of participants when forming project teams.

Participation is competitive due to the high number of applications received in previous editions.
For more details on the evaluation procedure read [this page](evaluation).
