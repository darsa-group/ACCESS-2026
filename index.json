InsectAI ACCESS empowers early-career researchers to leverage state-of-the-art imaging techniques, AI and other methods to tackle challenges in insect ecology and entomology.\nWhere and when ACCESS-2026 is an in-person, residential summer school based in Aarhus, Denmark. The event will run from September 28th to October 3th, 2026 (provisional dates).\nWhat we offer • A fully-funded course - free tuition, and refunds for accommodation, food and travel for the selected candidates: we can support between 15 and 20 participants, but might be able to host a few self-funded candidates • A series of guest lectures and practical workshops from international experts • A project-based learning experience within a multidisciplinary student and mentor team Who the course is for • Biologists (entomologists, ecologists, etc) wanting to apply computational methods to their fields • Computer and data scientists (engineers, physicists, etc) seeking to translate their expertise to study insects • We particularly support early-career researchers (graduate students, PhDs and postdocs) What will you do The course is structured around a group project you will develop in a team of 2-4 students. We will provide you with a mock funding call, and you and your team will write a collaborative research project to submit as a mock proposal.\nEach group is assigned a mentor that will advise them on their project before and during the in-person course, and will offer guidance on self-guided resources to prepare for the course (i.e. relevant papers, coding tutorials, etc).\nYou will meet online with your group starting around 2 months in advance of the in-person course, and start work on your collaborative project. Before and during the course there will be opportunities for feedback from peers, mentors and instructors.\nThe in-person course in Aarhus will consist of lectures, case studies and workshops, with time allocated for group project work each day.\n","date":1607817600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1607817600,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"","section":"authors","summary":"AI and deep learning are transforming research in ecology and entomology, but starting to use and developing these methods – and applying them to real-world problems – can be daunting.","tags":null,"title":"ACCESS-2026","type":"authors"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Quentin, assistant professor in the QGG, in Aarhus University is the Principal Investigator of the DARSA group.

This helps us assess your motivation to attend the summer school and its potential impact on your career.\nThe second paragraph should describe one or more specific research project(s), question(s) or problem(s) you are excited to tackle in invertebrate evolution, ecology, behaviour, conservation, distribution, or related fields. This allows us to evaluate your creativity and your ability to identify meaningful gaps / opportunities in the field. You will not necessarily work on the problem(s) you describe here; this paragraph helps us gauge your current understanding and research interests.\nBecause the course is project-based, the proposed research idea(s) are an important part of the application. Your project could involve monitoring insect behaviour in the field or laboratory, detecting or quantifying traits in specimens, building new hardware or mobile applications, automating existing research tasks, or generating new types of biological data. We are interested in a broad range of ideas related to computational entomology and will also consider projects involving other terrestrial invertebrates.\nApplications will be reviewed by the organisers with the help of a select group of core members from InsectAI. All submitted information is treated confidentially, and applicants may request deletion of their data after the notice period has ended (see “Selection outcome”).\nEach application will be reviewed by two evaluators whenever possible, while avoiding conflicts of interest (for example supervisor–student or teacher–student relationships).\nShortlisting The first stage of the evaluation is based only on the two paragraphs submitted in the application form. These two components have equal weighting and are used to assess:\nmotivation and relevance of the course to the applicant’s career originality and feasibility of the proposed research question Based on this first evaluation, we will pre-select a number of candidates corresponding to approximately 1.5 times the number of available places.\nEvaluators will then discuss the shortlisted candidates collectively and attempt to group applicants into thematic clusters that could form productive project teams.\nFinal evaluation During the final stage we will also examine the submitted CVs to support the final decision. Complementarity between candidates, including differences in expertise, background, and skills, is also considered.\nPlease note that joint applications are not permitted. Applicants should not attempt to coordinate their submissions with other candidates.\nSelection outcome Once teams have been formed, selected candidates will be contacted to confirm their acceptance. This is expected to occur around the beginning of June 2026. Selected candidates will have 15 days to confirm their participation; otherwise the place will be offered to the next candidate on the list.\nThere may be more selected candidates than available funding. In this case, applicants will be contacted in order of evaluation score and asked whether they could attend the course using their own funding (for example scholarships, institutional support, or scientific society grants). Invitations to participate with personal funding depend first on evaluation score and second on the availability of funds.\nWhen all places have been filled, the results will be communicated to all remaining applicants, at the latest by the end of June 2026.\nIn previous editions the course has received a large number of applications, so please keep in mind that participation is competitive.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"c4026e6186ad71210e1459ac5b61a81a","permalink":"https://darsa.info/ACCESS-2026/evaluation/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/ACCESS-2026/evaluation/","section":"","summary":"In the application form you will be asked to provide some personal details, upload your CV, and write two short paragraphs of up to 1500 characters each.\nThe first paragraph should describe your background, your interest in the topic, and what you hope to gain from the course.","tags":null,"title":"Evaluation procedure","type":"page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The summer school is sponsored by the InsectAI COST Action, and reimbursements follows the rules of the COST Association. There are no special provisions for training courses, so reimbursement follows the general event attendance rules.\nThis means that participants must initially cover their own expenses and submit a reimbursement claim after the course has ended. Unfortunately, due to administrative constraints, we cannot directly pay for travel or accommodation.\nReimbursement consists of two components: travel costs and a daily allowance.\nFor the travel costs, participants must submit receipts for travel exceeding 50 km. The reimbursable amount corresponds to the exact documented cost. Please note that only direct and uninterrupted travel can be reimbursed. If a stop longer than 24 hours is made on the way to the event, only one leg of the journey may be reimbursed under COST rules.Additionally, cumulative tickets (e.g. Interrail) are not claimable, not even in part. Travel costs should not exceed 500 EUR. For selected candidates travelling from outside mainland Europe \u0026amp; UK, we will be in touch separately.\nThe daily allowance is a fixed per-diem amount intended to cover accommodation, meals, and local travel (\u0026lt;50 km). It is possible that participants receive an invoice from the venue for these costs shortly before the course begins. The daily allowance will be sufficient to cover the venue invoice as well as additional costs.\nAll reimbursements are made in Euros, irrespective of the currency of the expenses.\nYou can find more details on the Annotated rules for COST Actions document (version v3.0, Sep 2025 when consulted), specifically section A1-3.1 Travel reimbursement rules.\nTo illustrate how the process typically works: a candidate applies to ACCESS before 15 April and receives an offer to attend on 20 May. After accepting the offer, she books her travel to Aarhus, paying approximately 350 EUR for a return ticket. Shortly before the course (around 15 August), she receives an invoice for accommodation and meals of 5,600 DKK (~750 EUR), which she pays directly to the venue. During the course, participants receive guidance on how to complete their reimbursement claim. After ACCESS concludes, she submits the claim and receives the full reimbursement of 1,100 EUR within 1–4 weeks.\nIn previous years, some participants arranged for their institution or research grant to temporarily cover travel and accommodation costs. After receiving the reimbursement, they returned the funds to their institution or grant. The exact procedure depends on the institution or grant involved, so participants should contact their local administrators if they wish to explore this option. Please note that reimbursements must be made to individuals and cannot be paid directly to institutions or grants.\nWe recognise that covering expenses upfront can be challenging. While this is a limitation of the COST reimbursement system, we will do everything possible to make the reimbursement process clear, efficient, and quick, so that participants are reimbursed as soon as possible.\nIf you have any questions or concerns about the financial aspects of attending the course, please do not hesitate to contact us.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"cf9d5b163d5e68c7e7642b06ae904804","permalink":"https://darsa.info/ACCESS-2026/financials/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/ACCESS-2026/financials/","section":"","summary":"The summer school is sponsored by the InsectAI COST Action, and reimbursements follows the rules of the COST Association.

While it is an advantage to have previous experience with coding, working with electronics and so on, and this is taken into account during evaluation, it does not preclude your participation. Students are expected to do up to 30h of preparation for the course, and this includes self-guided coding tutorials, for example.\nWill I learn how to code during the course?!? Unlikely, there’s only so much we can show you in a week! However, the workshops and demos should are structured in a way that you should be able to follow even with no technical background. The aim of the course is to signpost resources and approaches that you can use to learn what you need to leverage state-of-the-art technology for insects monitoring.\nWill I get to work on my own project during the summer school? Not necessarily. You will work on a project together with your group (2-3 students) and supported by your mentor; this project may or may not be close to the project you submitted during application. We try our best to match students with similar interests, and sometimes groups end up working on a project close to one of the members’, but some other times you will have to come up with a new project to work on all together.\nSo what’s the point of submitting a project during application?!? It serves two purposes: to evaluate your existing understanding of the technologies we touch on during the course and how you foresee them applied to your research; and it allows us to get to know your interests and therefore create groups around a similar theme as well as assigning mentors based on their expertise.\nCan I submit multiple project ideas in my application? Yes you can, but space is limited (1500 characters for the second “paragraph” of the application), so there is a trade-off in how much detail you can go into for each of your ideas.\nWill we run an experiment during the course? Unfortunately no, due to the short duration we do not have the time to collect much data. You are more than welcome to bring your own data to explore during the course though!\nHow does mentoring work? Each team is assigned a mentor based on their theme, and the mentor will be chosen based on their expertise; each mentor follows only one team. The team and the mentor will meet (virtually) a few times in the months leading up to the in-person course, and develop together the collaborative project idea. During the in-person course, mentors will be around and can answer any questions and offer support to theirs or any other team. We have organised “mentor swaps” where teams explain their project to other mentors than their own and receive feedback. In general, mentors are there to help you get the most out of the course, so feel free to reach out before, during or after the course!\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"4a1318da06786ac52626178ca960109e","permalink":"https://darsa.info/ACCESS-2026/faq/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/ACCESS-2026/faq/","section":"","summary":"I have no previous programming / electronics experience, can I participate?
